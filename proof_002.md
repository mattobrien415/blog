Summary: This proof revolves around basic closure properties of functions of bounded variation. I first studied these functions while taking Math 710 from Dr. Ovchinnikov, who wrote this [textbook](http://www.amazon.com/Measure-Integral-Derivative-Lebesgues-Universitext/dp/1461471958) for the course.
