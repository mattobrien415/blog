&lt;p&gt;A few years back, the Ring Magazine compiled a list of &lt;a href="http://boxing.about.com/od/history/a/ring_80_best.htm"&gt;The 80 Best Boxers of the Last 80 Years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a solid list, compiled by the definitive boxing authority. But it is fundamentally just..well, a list. Which is a bit boring. It got me thinking of ways to get a better feel for what these boxers' accomplished throughout the duration of their careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do that, I created an app which allows us to see where in the world these 80 pugilists plied their trade. We can explore chronologically, or by their opponent's names, and see how the top guys wrecked shop all over the world. There are big 'W', 'L', or 'D' letters plotted directly on a zoomable map, to indicate what happened and where.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a screenshot:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mobbSF/blog/master/content/sport/image_007.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can &lt;a href="https://mattobriendotme.shinyapps.io/top_80_career_viewer/"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; to play with it yourself, which is a lot more fun than looking at my screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of screenshots, you can see below, that some fighters travelled all over the place. This is the career of the Old Mongoose himself, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Moore"&gt;Archie Moore&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Archie Moore's career" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mobbSF/blog/master/content/sport/image_005.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we have guys like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Marciano"&gt;Rocky Marciano&lt;/a&gt;, who stuck pretty much to his own backyard during the duration of his short but undefeated career: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a look at &lt;a href="https://mattobriendotme.shinyapps.io/top_80_career_viewer/"&gt;the app&lt;/a&gt; and play with it! Let me know what you think in the comments. I'd also appreciate a heads up on any bugs you might find.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="sport science"></category><category term="boxing"></category></entry><entry><title>A nation by nation look at knockouts in boxing</title><link href="http://mattobrien.me/a-nation-by-nation-look-at-knockouts-in-boxing.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-05-31T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2016-05-31T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Matt O'Brien</name></author><id>tag:mattobrien.me,2016-05-31:/a-nation-by-nation-look-at-knockouts-in-boxing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Aggregating boxing outcomes by nation of origin&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;A nation by nation look at knockouts in boxing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a question for you: Who scores more knockouts as a whole, Mexican fighters or Philipino fighters?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(tl;dr: click &lt;a href="https://mattobriendotme.shinyapps.io/ko_by_countries/" title="Knockouts by Nation"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to find out yourself.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a good question...and it's one that could certainly stir up some impassioned debate on various online forums. Unfortunately, we'd all be stuck debating based on our intuition. It is impossible to answer this kind of question without looking directly at the numbers. But unlike other sports such as baseball or basketball, the cold hard facts are sometimes harder to come across in boxing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to answer this question, I collected over 4 million records of fights from all over the world, from all eras. I looked at what country the winners were from, and how they won the fights. I created a tool to help visualize the results. You can play around with it yourself &lt;a href="https://mattobriendotme.shinyapps.io/ko_by_countries/" title="Knockouts by Nation"&gt;by clicking here&lt;/a&gt;. With it, you can compare any number of countries, side by side, and see which one has produced the most knockouts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget about compairing Mexico and the Philipines for a second. How about...Ghana and Austrailia?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Now might be a good time to take a break and rewatch the the Ring Magazine's offical 'Upset of the Year' way back in 1992! Yes, of course I'm talking about the rematch between &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsqmNOAw1Sk"&gt;Jeff Fenech and Azumah Nelson&lt;/a&gt;.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out that Austraila, as a whole, doesn't seem to be producing a whole slew of knockout punchers. Their percent of stoppages is well below 50...but on the other hand, Ghana is around 60%.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Ghana vs. Austraila" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mobbSF/blog/master/content/sport/image_001.png" /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notice that "Other" on the far right of the graph, contains stuff like Draws, No Contests, and other non-definitive outcomes.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool gets more fun when you look at side-by-side comparisons between more than 2 nations (the dropdown on the left has over 100 countries to choose from):  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Jamacia, Switzerland, Isreal" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mobbSF/blog/master/content/sport/image_002.png" /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appears that the Israelis have the advantage. Historically, Jamacia doesn't seem to be doing a while lot of winning by KO.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Did you find this useful or interesting? Let me know in the comments section if you find anything surprising.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="sport science"></category><category term="visualization"></category></entry><entry><title>An analysis of stoppages in boxing</title><link href="http://mattobrien.me/an-analysis-of-stoppages-in-boxing.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-05-18T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2016-05-18T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Matt O'Brien</name></author><id>tag:mattobrien.me,2016-05-18:/an-analysis-of-stoppages-in-boxing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some perspectives on knockouts&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;An analysis of stoppages in boxing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knockouts are truly the most dramatic, exciting, terrifying, heartbreaking and exhilarating outcome of any sporting event.  Along with the basic knockout, there is also the TKO that occurs when the ref waves it off. A fighter can also retire in between rounds if the fighter (or more likely, their corner) has seen enough and knows there is no decent chance of winning.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what do we really know about these stoppages? No, I don't mean in terms of brain injury and health (that's another topic for another time), but from the big picture?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I collected a gigantic set of over 3.3 million boxing matches that spanned all eras of the sport, in every division, with all countries included. I filtered out how many fights ended by knockout, and dove in to see what I could find out. Of these 3.3 million fights, 1,275,316 of them ended in a stoppage.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This resulting dataset is a large enough so that we should be confident that insights found within can safely extend to the whole of the sport.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My three main questions are:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) What percent of fights end in a stoppage?&lt;br /&gt;
1) What round do knockout happen more frequently?  &lt;br /&gt;
2) What weight classes see the most knockouts?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;#1:&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first question is the simplest. Clearly not every fight ends in a knockout. I'd say that stoppages are a minority. If you are a boxing fan (and you probably are if you are reading this), then you probably already have a pretty good number in your head. Maybe 20%? 40%?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the data, the number I got was [1275316 /  3330197] * 100  = 38.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So the percentage then is thirty eight.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this match your intuition? For me, it sounds about right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;#2:&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, let's look at how stoppages are distributed across rounds. Of these 1,275,316 stoppages, here's &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; they happen:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="stoppages across rounds" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mobbSF/blog/master/content/sport/image_003.png" /&gt; 
&lt;em&gt;The x-axis is the round, and the y-axis is the count.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stoppages happen most often in the second round.&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why might this be? Maybe you could argue that most boxing matches that end in stoppage are by definition a mismatch -- and it happens quick, mostly within 4 rounds.  Maybe it's harder to get a knockout later, because familiarity between fighters grow, and the fight becomes a pattern.  I can only use the numbers to supply the outcome, not the cause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what the reason, it's clear that those Chavez Sr vs Taylor 12 round endings are extremely rare indeed!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgenYK7VaxY"&gt;&lt;img alt="Chavez Sr vs Taylor 12" src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/AgenYK7VaxY/0.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Julio Cesar Chavez Jr KO12 Meldrick Taylor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;#3:&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, what about weight classes? Which division is the most dangerous, where the most knockouts happen? I wouldn't be surprised if the first reaction for most people is 'heavyweight.' Let's see what the numbers say:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="stoppages by division" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mobbSF/blog/master/content/sport/image_004.png" /&gt; 
&lt;em&gt;The x-axis is the weight class, and the y-axis is the count.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, by separating all fights that end in stoppage into their divisions, we find that &lt;strong&gt;welterweight and lightweight, both individually, barely beat out the big guys.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a bit surprising, especially since the heavyweight class includes both cruiserweights and light heavies, which covers a big span of possible weights.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unfortunate that, to quote  Rishad Marquardt from boxingnews24.com, &lt;a href="http://www.boxingnews24.com/2016/05/revival-interest-heavyweight-division-still-hot-air-least-now/"&gt;"The heavyweight division in boxing has, historically speaking, been the premier division within the sport."&lt;/a&gt;  The big fighters historically tend to dominate mainstream news coverage, but you can get more explosive action (and bigger headlines) if you also set your sights down to include a few more weight classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Recall, lightweight is between 130 lbs and less than 140 lbs.  Welterweight is between 140 and less than 154 lbs. 'Super' and 'Light' subclasses were folded in.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;So what does it all mean?&lt;/h1&gt; 
 Well, here's two take-home messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say you just lost all your money playing craps in Vegas, and you've only got $5 left in your pocket.  Go to the nearest sportsbook, and wager $5 on the next lightweight matchup. Pick a knockout in the 2nd round. That's your best chance for a decent payoff.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you want a safer bet, albeit a smaller payout? Recall that historically, only 38% of boxing matches end prematurely. You'd actually be better off putting your money on a 12 round decision on a pair of 105 lb combatants...so look for a minimumweight fight!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's another take-home. Say you are a coach. If you want your fighter to be a kayo artist, then consider training them to perform best in the second round (and to be sharpest on defense at that time as well).  Work on interval training where the highest workloads are early. Later intervals could focus more on endurance, footwork and jabs. After all, if there hasn't been a knockout by round 4, then probabistically speaking, the fight is probably going to the cards. Time to pile up points and impress the judges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;script type= "text/javascript"&gt;

I purchased an 8 strobe Optitrack system and asked an amateur fighter to put on the reflective suit and demonstrate his body kick. After I captured the movement, I discussed some of the findings in this animation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting thing about the clip is the overhead view. I realized that nobody has ever considered what a kick looks like from the top: when you observe it from this position, it quickly becomes clear that the kick is generated from the top down -- the shoulder girdle clearly rotates first and reaches it's peak torque prior to the completion of the rotation of the pelvis. If you go train in muay thai, it's not uncommon to hear a reguritated coaching dogma, namely, "Turn your hip over", which is somewhat true but really just betrays a lack of ability to consider the kick as a movement that is fundamentally a top-down kinetic chain.   &lt;/p&gt;
