&lt;p&gt;Here's a question for you: Who scores more knockouts as a whole, Mexican fighters or Philipino fighters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a good question...and it's one that could certainly stir up some impassioned debate on various online forums. Unfortunately, we'd all be stuck debating based on our intuition. It is impossible to answer this kind of question without looking directly at the numbers. But unlike other sports such as baseball or basketball, the cold hard facts are sometimes harder to come across in boxing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to answer this question, I collected over 4 million records of fights from all over the world, from all eras. I looked at what country the winners were from, and how they won the fights. I created a tool to help visualize the results. You can play around with it yourself &lt;a href="https://mattobriendotme.shinyapps.io/ko_by_countries/" title="Knockouts by Nation"&gt;by clicking here&lt;/a&gt;. With it, you can compare any number of countries, side by side, and see which one has produced the most knockouts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget about compairing Mexico and the Philipines for a second. How about...Ghana and Austrailia?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Now might be a good time to take a break and rewatch the the Ring Magazine's offical 'Upset of the Year' way back in 1992! Yes, of course I'm talking about the rematch between &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsqmNOAw1Sk"&gt;Jeff Fenech and Azumah Nelson&lt;/a&gt;.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out that Austraila, as a whole, doesn't seem to be producing a whole slew of knockout punchers. Their percent of stoppages is well below 50...but on the other hand, Ghana is around 60%.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Ghana vs. Austraila" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mobbSF/blog/master/content/sport/image_001.png" /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notice that "Other" on the far right of the graph, contains stuff like Draws, No Contests, and other non-definitive outcomes.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool gets more fun when you look at side-by-side comparisons between more than 2 nations (the dropdown on the left has over 100 countries to choose from):  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Jamacia, Switzerland, Isreal" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mobbSF/blog/master/content/sport/image_002.png" /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appears that the Israelis have the advantage. Historically, Jamacia doesn't seem to be doing a while lot of winning by KO.  &lt;/p&gt;

I purchased an 8 strobe Optitrack system and asked an amateur fighter to put on the reflective suit and demonstrate his body kick. After I captured the movement, I discussed some of the findings in this animation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting thing about the clip is the overhead view. I realized that nobody has ever considered what a kick looks like from the top: when you observe it from this position, it quickly becomes clear that the kick is generated from the top down -- the shoulder girdle clearly rotates first and reaches it's peak torque prior to the completion of the rotation of the pelvis. If you go train in muay thai, it's not uncommon to hear a reguritated coaching dogma, namely, "Turn your hip over", which is somewhat true but really just betrays a lack of ability to consider the kick as a movement that is fundamentally a top-down kinetic chain.   &lt;/p&gt;
