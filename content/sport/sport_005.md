Summary:  Fosbury Flop and muay thai

#### This post originally appeared on XXX

I love sports because whatever works, works. If you can figure out a smarter way to do something, and you do it, your odds of winning go up. This isn't to say that we need to run around trying to change and revolutionize everything. It's more about looking closely at what already works and then shaving off tiny bits of wasted movement. This is usually how improvement happens.  In sport science, they frame this as the [degrees of freedom problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_problem).

One notorious example of someone getting better by shaving off wasted movement came from a guy in Oregon named [Dick Fosbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Fosbury). Aside from having an awesome name, he also revolutionized the sport of pole vault. He figured out a technique that is now called the  Fosbury Flop. He ultimately ended up winning the gold medal at the Olympics and setting a new record simultaneously.  

I'll explain the Fosbury Flop here. Then we'll steal the idea. We'll apply it to defending against body kicks in muay thai. And we'll call our new version the Donut Defense, because that sounds like a fitting tribute to the Fosbury Flop.

First, read this next paragraph three times, because it sounds like gibberish at first:  

The shocking truth behind the Fosbury Flop is that our friend Dick Fosbury actually figured out how to made his center of mass go *UNDER* the bar at the exact same time as he was jumping *OVER* the bar. 

This should make no sense right now to anyone reading this, assuming you don't already know about the Fosbury Flop. But I assure you, this is the kind of forehead slapping idea that makes perfect sense once it clicks. So bear with me and just look at these pretty pictures:  

#### Check out the black dot. That's the center of mass of a basketball, right?

#### Check out the black dot. That's the center of mass of a donut, right?

Your mind should be blown because you just admitted to yourself that the center of mass of a donut is not actually **inside** the donut.

#### Check out the black dot. That's the center of mass of a half of a donut, after we cut off the bottom, right?

#### Now, what if you bent over backwards, so you looked like a half a donut? Then jumped over the bar?

Yes, this is exactly what Dick did. He figured out that he could jump over the bar, while his center of mass went **under** the bar, allowing him to shave off wasted effort. Prior to this discovery, it was just basically assumed by everyone else that the jumper's center of mass always had to go **over** the bar.  

The bottom line...Fosbury could move the bar up higher than anyone else, and still clear it. That's Olympic gold in the bank right there. 

So what does any of this have to do with muay thai? And defense?

First, let's see what we are trying to optimize. We are trying to optimize a pretty straightforward response to a body kick. Naturally, we asume we should step back to get out of the way:

This is all fine and good, but could be better. Look at the black dots. 

You had to move your center of mass, two times. Once to get out of the way, and then once to get back where you started. 

* This costs energy
* This takes time
As a result, you can't counterattack, because you spent all your time and energy getting out of the way.

Now let's see the Donut Defense.

If Fosbury could get over the bar with his body in a donut shape, then you should consider avoiding a kick by putting your body in a donut shape too. See the images below:

![half-donut-gif](https://github.com/mobbSF/blog/blob/master/images/fosberry/half-donut-gif.gif?raw=true)

This is exactly the same thing that Fosbury did with the bar, but now the other guy's shin is going through your center of mass. And missing.

The advantage of *not* having to move your center of mass: 

* It costs less energy
* It takes less time
As a result, you can counterattack immediately because you are in position to do so.

I recommend to anyone at any level to add the Donut Defense to their shadowboxing and sparring. It's super simple. It's a good alternative to checking and catching. And it just makes a ton of sense from both theortical and practical perspectives.

Once you start to catch on, you see it happening all over the place. Here's Mayweather doing something similar versus Canelo. Mayweather is evading the punch and limiting how far back he needs to move his feet / center of mass:

Alright, I'm going to wrap it up here because I want to keep this short. 
Thanks for reading; I hope it was worth it. And I hope that no matter what level your training you may be at right now, you feel comfortable thinking critically about what you do in the gym. Please comment below!
