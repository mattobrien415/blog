Summary:  Fosbury Flop and muay thai

#### This post originally appeared 

I love sports because whatever works, works. If you can figure out a smarter way to do something, and you do it, then you win. Not to say that we need to go around trying to change and revolutionize everything all the time. It's more about looking closely at what already works and then shaving off tiny bits of wasted movement. This is usually how we get improvement.  In sport science, they frame this as the [degrees of freedom problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_problem).

One notorious example of someone getting better by shaving off wasted movement came from a guy in Oregon named [Dick Fosbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Fosbury). Aside from having an awesome name, he also revolutionized the sport of pole vault. He figured out a technique that is now called the  Fosbury Flop. He ultimately ended up winning the gold medal at the Olympics and setting a new record at the same time.  

 I'll explain it here.   

First, read this three times:  

The shocking truth behind the Fosbury Flop is that our friend Dick Fosbury actually made his center of mass go *UNDER* the bar he was supposed to jump *OVER*. 

This should make no sense right now to anyone reading this, assuming you don't already know about the Fosbury Flop. But I assure you, this is the kind of forehead slapping idea that makes perfect sense once it clicks. So bear with me and just look at the pretty pictures:  

#### Check out the black dot. That's the center of mass of a basketball, right?

#### Check out the black dot. That's the center of mass of a donut, right?

Your mind should be blown because you just admitted that the center of mass of a donut is not actually **inside** the donut.

#### Check out the black dot. That's the center of mass of a donut, after we cut it up, right?:

#### Now, What if you bent over backwards, so you looked like a half a donut? Then jumped over the bar?

Yes, Fosbury figured out that he could jump over the bar, while his center of mass went **under** the bar, allowing him to maximize the return on his effort. Prior to this discovery, it was assumed the center of mass always had to go **over** the bar.
Meaning...he could move the bar up higher than anyone else, and still clear it. Easy Olympic gold. 

So what does any of this have to do with muay thai? And defense?

First, let's see what we are trying to optimize. I call this the 'Non-Donut Method'. The Non-Donut-Method (NDM?) is pretty straightforward. When someone kicks you, step back:


This is all fine and dandy, but look at the black dots. 

You had to move your center of mass, twice. Once to get out of the way, and once to get back where you started. 

* It cost energy
* It cost time
* You can't attack back because you are out of range

Now let's see the Half A Donut Method.  

If Fosbury could get over the bar with his body in a donut shape, then you should consider avoiding a kick by putting your body in a donut shape too. See the image below:


This is exactly the same thing that Fosbury did with the bar, but now the other guy's shin is going through your center of mass. And missing.

* The advantage is that you con't have to move your center of mass
* It costs less energy
* It cost less time
* You can attack back right away because you are in range  

I recommend to anyone at any level to add the Half A Donut Method to their shadowboxing and sparring. It's too easy, it makes too much sense, and it's got a ton of bang for the buck.

Once you start to catch on, you see it happening all over the place. Here's Mayweather doing something similar versus Canelo. Mayweather is evading the punch and limiting how far back he needs to move his feet (and center of mass):

I'm going to wrap it up because I want to keep this short. 
Thanks for reading; I hope it was worth it...and hope folks, no matter what level at your training you may be, feel comfortable thinking critically about what you do in the gym. Please comment below!
